plover_dict_converter
=====================

A script to convert an RTF/CRE dictionary to a plover dictionary.

Eventually, this may be added to plover itself so it can directly load the dictionary.

This script relies on PLY: http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/

The script is invoked as:

convert_rtfcre_to_json_dict.py <input rtf file> > output_dict.json 2> report.txt

Make sure to read the report.

This is a first draft and needs some cleanup and improvement in usability.
